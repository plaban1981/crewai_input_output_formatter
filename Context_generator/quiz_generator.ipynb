      "**What is OpenAI Whisper?**\n",

      "OpenAI Whisper is an advanced automatic speech recognition (ASR) model that can transcribe audio into text in multiple languages and even translate it into English.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How does Whisper work?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Whisper uses a simple end-to-end approach implemented as an encoder-decoder Transformer. It splits input audio into 30-second chunks, converts them into log-Mel spectrograms, and then passes them through an encoder to generate the final transcription.\n",

      "**Advantages of Whisper over Google Speech-to-Text:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Whisper prioritizes privacy, offline use, and cost-efficiency, making it a better choice for scenarios where these factors are important. However, it may not be as scalable or cloud-integrated as Google Speech-to-Text for real-time applications.\n",

      "**What is the purpose of Whisper?**\n",
